	abstract = {Interpretation of regression coefﬁcients is sensitive to the scale of the inputs. One method often used to place input variables on a common scale is to divide each numeric variable by its standard deviation. Here we propose dividing each numeric variable by two times its standard deviation, so that the generic comparison is with inputs equal to the mean ±1 standard deviation. The resulting coefﬁcients are then directly comparable for untransformed binary predictors. We have implemented the procedure as a function in R. We illustrate the method with two simple analyses that are typical of applied modeling: a linear regression of data from the National Election Study and a multilevel logistic regression of data on the prevalence of rodents in New York City apartments. We recommend our rescaling as a default option—an improvement upon the usual approach of including variables in whatever way they are coded in the data ﬁle—so that the magnitudes of coefﬁcients can be directly compared as a matter of routine statistical practice.

	abstract = {Chapter 2 dealt with aspects of modeling such as transformations of predictors, relaxing linearity assumptions, modeling interactions, and examining lack of fit. Chapter 3 dealt with missing data, focusing on utilization of incomplete predictor information. All of these areas are important in the overall scheme of model development, and they cannot be separated from what is to follow. In this chapter we concern ourselves with issues related to the whole model, with emphasis on deciding on the amount of complexity to allow in the model and on dealing with large numbers of predictors. The chapter concludes with three default modeling strategies depending on whether the goal is prediction, estimation, or hypothesis testing.},
