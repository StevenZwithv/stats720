thank you for labeling chunks!
single imputation is dicey (I should have spent more time on this in class)
looking at *marginal* distributions of data is rarely useful
interesting that convergence warning gives such a big gradient; scaling age and mage actually takes care of this
I would probably have allowed age effect to vary by district ...
Should always scale predictors if plotting a coefficient plot!
Comment on results of simulation?
