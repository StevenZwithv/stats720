	abstract = {Inconsistencies have been observed in the impact of vitamin A ({VA}) supplementation on early child growth. To help clarify this issue, a cohort of 3377 rural Nepalese, nonxerophthalmic children 12–60 mo of age were randomized by ward to receive vitamin A [60,000 μg retinol equivalents ({RE})] or placebo-control (300 {RE}) supplementation once every 4 mo and followed for 16 mo. {VA} had no impact on annual weight gain or linear growth. However, arm circumference ({AC}) and muscle area ({MA}) growth improved in {VA} recipients, by 0.13 cm and 25 mm2, respectively, over controls. Growth of children with xerophthalmia, who were treated with ≥ 120,000 {RE} at base line, was also compared to that of nonxerophthalmic children, stratified by initial wasting status, and adjusted for sex, baseline age and measurement status. Among initially nonwasted children ({AC} ≥ 13.5 cm), {VA}-treated xerophthalmic children (n = 86) gained 0.7 cm more in linear growth than nonxerophthalmic children. Among initially wasted children ({AC} {\textless} 13.5 cm), {VA}-treated children (n = 34) gained additional weight (672 g), height ({\textasciitilde}1 cm), muscle (76 mm2) and fat (79 mm2) areas, and subscapular skinfold (1.3 mm) compared to changes observed in nonxerophthalmic children. Relative increments in soft tissue growth occurred within 4 mo of {VA} treatment, while the effect on linear growth was gradual. Moderate-to-severe {VA} deficiency, marked by xerophthalmia, is likely to impair normal physical growth, but milder stages of deficiency may not have this effect in rural South Asia.},
